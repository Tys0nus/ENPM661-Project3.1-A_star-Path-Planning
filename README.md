How to run the code:
--------------------

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the repository directory.
3.  Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4.  Run the `main.py` file using `python main.py` command.
5.  The code will prompt the user for inputs as follows:
    -   Step size
    -   Wall clearance
    -   Robot radius
    -   Start node coordinates and orientation (as three consecutives values with spaces)
    -   Goal node coordinates and orientation (as three consecutives values with spaces)
6.  Enter the required inputs and press enter.
7.  Wait for the code to execute, as it may take some time to complete.
8.  The result will be displayed as an animation of finding the goal node and visualizing the optimal path.
